# The-Trojan-Horse_Clash_of_Codes

This project was made during the 24hrs Clash-of-Codes hackathon (DJSCE).

> PS: While travel can certainly involve visiting new places and seeing
interesting sights, the opportunity to meet new people and make
meaningful connections is often a significant part of the experience.
Design an app/website to facilitate these connections. By matching solo
travellers with potential travel companions, the app could help people
build relationships and make the most of their journeys.
